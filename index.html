              The Loud House is an American animated television series created by Chris Savino for Nickelodeon.The series revolves around the chaotic everyday life of a boy named Lincoln Loud, who is the middle child and only son in a large family of 11 children. It is set in a fictional town in southeastern Michigan called Royal Woods, based on Savino's hometown of Royal Oak. The series was pitched to the network in 2013 as a two-minute short film entered in the annual Animated Shorts Program. It entered production the following year. The series is based on Savino's own childhood growing up in a large family, and its animation is largely influenced by newspaper comic strips.

               <img src="/assets/lynn.sr.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
              <p class="mb-1">According to "L is for Love" and The Loud House Movie, he met Rita when he was walking through the street and they fell in love at first sight. Since she was too shy to directly talk to him, she slipped love letters to him whenever he passed by, eventually asking him out on a date at Banger's & MoshLynn Sr. wanted to be a chef, but to keep his wife and children fed and well, he worked as an IT specialist. He eventually quit that job in "Job Insecurity" and began working at the Aloha Comrade, where he initially worked as a dish-washer (a job he personally hated) before being promoted to co-chef. Several months later, he finally achieved his dream of opening his own restaurant, Lynn's Table, in "Cooked!"</p>

              <h1>Rita</h1>
              <img src="/assets/rita.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
              <p>Rita is caring towards her children, but is not afraid to punish them if they go too far. She and her husband act playfully romantic towards each other, though she is apparently more level-headed than him. An example of this is when she's concerned about Lincoln playing video games too much and tells him to do some sport outside in "The Loudest Yard".She dreams to be a novelist but initially seems to lack a creative side, as she wrote a story about a bored dental assistant talking to her fish before being inspired by Lincoln to write about a thrill seeker with white hair, himself.</p>

              <img src="/assets/lori.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
              <p>Lori is bossy and she has a bad temper. As such, Lori tends to come off as somewhat rude and condescending towards those not familiar with her, but aside from that, she is friendly and kind.She does not like the others touching her possessions, especially her cell phone, which seems to be her most valuable object. The reason for this is that she does not want to waste her phone memory for messages other than the ones from Bobby. She is also very territorial as she loudly yells at anyone who goes into her room without permission before kicking them out. She is also shown to be protective, as she locks her room with a key and electronic keypad lock.In some occasions she acts without thinking, and commits malicious actions against the others for her own selfish benefits, like in "Driving Miss Hazy" when she tries to stop Leni from learning to drive so that she can remain the only Loud kid with a license, but since her love for her family always comes before any petty problem, she has a caring heart underneath a rough exterior, and she will always try to fix her mistakes. Deep down, Lori is insecure; it is shown that while she gets annoyed and easily agitated by a lot of people, she feels lonely without the people she loves and cares about (such as Bobby and her family) and her worst fear is in fact, losing their approval. Despite this, she is not very interested in other sports.Like Leni, Lori has an interest in fashion, though unlike Leni, she doesn't make clothes. </p>

              <img src="/assets/leni.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
              <p>Despite being the second-oldest of the Loud children, Leni is quite ditzy and is very forgetful, absent-minded, perky and not that bright. Various examples of her simple-mindedness are expressed throughout the series. In "Linc or Swim," she does not know the rules of the game, "Marco Polo," much to Luan's annoyance. In "Project Loud House," she is shown to be unable to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. When she's being interrogated by Lincoln and Lucy in "Sleuth or Consequences," she thinks they are interviewing her, and states that her favorite color is "zebra." Her ditzy nature has also caused her to behave like a child, such as in "Changing the Baby," where she gets stuck in Lily's crib, calls it a "baby prison," bawls like a baby, and then gratefully says "agoo" once Lincoln and Lori get her out; and in "Sitting Bull," where she gets an "ouchie" (a term for when babies and young kids get hurt) and is then cheered up when Luan hits herself with a hammer prop, which she does to cheer up the children she looks after when babysitting. In "Schooled!", when she accidentally attends preschool, she starts behaving like the other preschoolers to the point where she's even sucking her thumb while taking a nap.Despite being ditzy and absent-minded, Leni's shown to be skilled at fashion designing, wood carving, singing, lock-picking, and making smoothies, which demonstrates that while she may not be very bright, she is creative and artistically inclined. She is also very friendly and gets along well with her siblings Leni is arachnophobic.</p>

              <img src="/assets/luna.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
              <p>Luna is very happy, wild, caring, and easily the loudest sibling of the entire family. What she likes most is singing, playing musical instruments, and being with her family.Before she became interested in rock music, Luna was a shy, gentle and classy girly girl. After her first concert, she developed an interest in rock music. She is a big fan of several rock groups, and her dream is to become a rockstar. She owns and plays an electric guitar, with which she has proved to be a very good guitarist. Her skills aren't limited to just the guitar though. She also plays the drums, as well as other instruments, as seen throughout the series, like the violin in "Overnight Success". She sometimes talks with a fake British accent, especially when she listens to music; something that her siblings consider to be an annoying habit.Most of the time, she can be found practicing with her guitar or listening to rock music. She sometimes gets angry and threatening with her fists. However, most of the time, she uses the vibration sounds of her guitar as a weapon to harm someone when she gets upset.She will get upset if someone turns off her music, and in some cases, she will get agitated by her siblings. She sometimes gets downhearted when her family isn't with her, or when she upsets her siblings. This was most prominently seen in "House Music".</p>

              <p>she has a taste for everything that is related to comedy - this includes comedy movies and TV series, clowns, pranks, stand-up comedy, and funny internet videos. Her most common pranking methods are dodging people in the face with pies and placing a whoopie cushion on others' seats. She also likes to record people experiencing funny situations with her video camera.</p>

             <p>Lynn is athletic and competitive. She loves to play sports and enjoys roughhousing with her siblings.She enjoys playing every existing sport, including football, soccer, hockey, basketball, and baseball. She is also skilled in various forms of martial arts, such as kickboxing, Mexican wrestling. Lynn tends to turn everything into a competition her siblings consider this to be her most annoying habit. She is also shown to be very competitive, and strives to be "number one" in every game she plays, even when winning isn't involved.</p>

             <p>Lincoln is a good-hearted and well-meaning person, who is always looking for fun, and thinking about the well-being of others. As the family nerd, along with Lisa, Lincoln is an avid fancier of comic books, manga, video games, fantasy, and science fiction stories, which are typical interests for a boy his age. His favorite comics are Ace Savvy, David's Castle, and Comix Jokes. His favorite music band is SMOOCH.He is known to be "the man with a plan," as he is usually elaborating plans with a specific objective, most of them for his own benefit. His plans rarely succeed because of his own selfish and reckless decisions or by his sisters' interference. When he goes too far, he will always find the solution even if that means making himself look like a fool.Lincoln's best friends are Clyde, Liam, Rusty, Zach, Ronnie Anne, and Stella. Sometimes, he hangs out with other kids, but the rest of his social life has not been explored, and other kids can tease him depending on the circumstance.</p>

              <p>Lucy is a gloomy, cynical, deadpan, and mysterious goth girl who is almost always seen with a stoic frown. She is interested in occultism, poetry, and the works of Gothic authors. She has an uncanny ability to seemingly teleport to different places, which often spooks her siblings, especially Lincoln. Some of her siblings refer her as a "spooky" girl. She frequently uses words to describe her actions, such as saying the word "Sigh" instead of actually sighing. Occasionally, she feels left out that nobody listens to her and everyone thinks she is weird (despite their obvious quirks), however this is likely not the reason for her gloominess, because "The Whole Picture", "The Crying Dame", and "Not a Loud" prove that Lucy frowned and wore black even as a baby.though typically rather gloomy, she is shown to be happy on several occasions. She squeals and giggles in "Heavy Meddle", along with her sisters, upon learning of Lincoln's romantic situation.</p>

             <img src="/assets/lana.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
            <p>Lana is a tomboy, contrasting with her twin's more girly personality. She loves to play in mud and enjoys getting her hands dirty. Her pleasures are found in filth of all kinds, and anything unhygienic, from frogs to digging in the trash for chewed gum to doing business outdoors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-group-item py-3">
              <h1>Lola</h1>
              <img src="/assets/lola.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="50%" height="50%">
               <p>Lola is a sharp-tongued beauty queen. She carries a great sense of self-importance, and is always ready to be on the offense if someone crosses her. She can be quite materialistic and will go to great lengths to get what she wants. She is particularly skilled at making money (even if she must deceive others), and dedicates much of her time to winning beauty pageants. Despite being image-focused she takes school seriously, and makes it a point to get her work done in order to allow her the flexibility to focus on pageant training. Lola's interests include anything girly - this includes fashion shows, makeup, and posing for photo shoots. She is constantly claiming how beautiful she is, and can't look away from a mirror for more than five seconds, which gets on everybody's nerves. Even though she is determined to get her way most of the time, she often shows remorse or guilt if she hurts the feelings of one of her family members.As seen in a few episodes (such as "Undie Pressure", "Sound of Silence", and "A Tattler's Tale"), she is skilled at plotting and scheming to get her way. She has the most tense temper of all of the siblings, and so her siblings, especially Lincoln, are careful not to get on her bad side and to carry the mandates she demands.</p>

              <p>Though the second-youngest of the Louds, Lisa is a child prodigy, so she's the smartest kid in the bunch. Because of this, she often tends to be egocentric, boorish, condescending, and sarcastic with other people. She speaks with a lateral lisp, and usually has a stoic frown, though she does smile from time to time.She is not as easily excited as her siblings, although sometimes she becomes excited when something really good happens, like when she and the other sisters discover Lincoln's romantic situation in "Heavy Meddle". She states that this is because she does not partake in "mundane human emotions", which she first stated in "Heavy Meddle". She was also shown to have fallen for Hugh like all of her other sisters, and showed a more immature side to her, at one point having Hugh show off his six pack under the lie that she was teaching Lola human anatomy with him as an example. She also became somewhat irrational, claiming she would marry Hugh, and have children with him, despite the obvious age difference, and following him around like her other sisters. She also does not believe in superstition, fortune telling, blessings or curses as she is a realist and believes only in science.</p>

              <p>Although still learning to talk, she seems to understand her brother and sisters quite often, such as when Luan wanted her to be a ventriloquist dummy. She is very cheerful, and loves to be near her siblings. She is most frequently seen in the care of Lincoln, Luna, Leni, and Lori.It is implied that she is just as feminine as Lori, Leni, and Lola, as she wished to go to the beach, while Lincoln's tomboyish sisters wanted to go to an amusement park instead.Despite her cheerfulness, she is not above fighting back if rubbed the wrong way. In "Brawl in the Family", she chastises Lincoln for continuing to butt into Lori and Leni's feud and later gets in a big fight with her sisters after Lincoln reveals things some of the sisters said about each other. In "Room with a Feud", after Lori accidentally steps on her phone, she retaliates by posting a humiliating photo of Lori online. In "Selfie Improvement", she gets angry at Lori for refusing to change her and removes her diaper, throwing it at Lori's face.</p>
